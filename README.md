# The Definitive Guide to the Elastic Certified Engineer Exam v8.1

This is the website for The Definitive Guide to the Elastic Certified Engineer Exam v8.1. This book will attempt to go over all of the various topics that may appear in the Elastic Certified Engineer Exam, but it is by no means comprehensive. Using the list of modules and topics from the landing page on the Elastic site for the exam I have created as many examples as I thought useful in the pursuit of passing the test.

While you are learning enough to pass the test you will also start to learn some of the additional areas about Elastic that you may not have considered in your journey to learn what you can. Very little knowledge goes to waste so revel in the thought that studying for the exam will also make you a better Elasticsearch developer.

This website, hosted on Github, will always be free, but bear in mind that the Elastic exam will move on from Elasticsearch v8.1 to the whatever version they consider the most important for their certification.

If you run into any problems (and you will), [please report them here](mailto:esstudyguide@brushedsteelconsulting.com). I will update the content with the corrections as soon as possible. I appreciate your patience!

In general, the content from this website may not be copied or reproduced. The code examples are all so short that they do not exist in a Github repo anywhere. Copy and paste the various REST API calls from the HTML pages into the Elastic Kibana Console to your heart's content.

If you find the online edition of the book useful, please consider ordering a paper copy or the eBook [from your favorite vendor](https://books2read.com/es-cert-engineer-study-guide).
